Furthermore, the island is home to some of the lavish hotels and commercial and industrial buildings of the district. It is between Ernakulum Jetty and Kochi Port and the ferry costs around INR 6.<br></br>
            There is a bridge that connects the mainland of Kochi to Wellington Island. This human-made island also serves as the headquarter for the southern naval command of India.
